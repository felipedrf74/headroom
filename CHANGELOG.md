# Changelog

## 1.1 — 2026-09-11

### Menu bar
- Meters are iStat-style vertical capsules (5×18 pt, 1 pt outline). Fill is used % of the inner track, from the bottom.
- Icons are 16.4 pt. Grok and GPT marks are vectors; the Grok slash is the full even-odd logo, not a cropped PNG.
- Percents stay whole numbers when that is accurate, otherwise one decimal (for example `13.6%`).
- Glyphs, percents, and bars share a 20 pt row so marks are not clipped.

### Performance
- Unchanged usage no longer rewrites the extra or the snapshot cache.
- Opening the popover refreshes only if the last attempt is older than 45 seconds.
- Menu-bar drawing skips implicit animations.

### Fixes
- Grok Build glyph was missing half of the mark.
- Popover stays open on the first click and closes on a click outside.
- Settings opens a real window.

## 1.0 — 2026-09-09
